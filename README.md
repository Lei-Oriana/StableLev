# StableLev

This is the repository of dataset of multi-point acoustic levitation, combining both analytical features and experimental outcomes of dymamic levitation trajectories. Analytical features are generated by two distinct phase retrieval algorithms NAIVE and GSPAT.

Analytical features include：
Gor’kov potential (𝑈), Trapping stiffness (𝑆), Focal point amplitude (𝑎), Focal point Phase (𝜃), Point amplitude change (Δ𝑎), Point phase change (Δ𝜃), Average transducer phase change (Δ¯𝜙).

This dataset is ideal for researchers and engineers interested in analyzing the stability and motion performance of acoustic trapping.
